# What is splitmate?
Household Expense Settlement System.
This document is requirements document.

## Authentication
The application uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with Google OAuth for secure user authentication.

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Login with Google" button
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
3. After successful authentication, user is redirected back with JWT token
4. JWT token is stored in browser's localStorage
5. All subsequent API requests include JWT token in Authorization header
6. Token expires after 24 hours (configurable via JWT_EXPIRES_IN)

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables for JWT authentication:
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for signing JWT tokens
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Token expiration time (default: 24h)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth client secret

## Purpose
To streamline and automate the monthly household expense settlement process between spouses, reducing manual effort and human error while improving clarity and efficiency.

## Users

- **Husband**: Settlement handler (currently manages the processing)
- **Wife**: Settlement requester (provides receipts)
**Note:** The roles of “settlement handler” and “settlement requester” are interchangeable. Either the husband or the wife can take on these roles as needed.
## Expense Entry Items
| Field       | Description          | Required | Example   |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Category    | Type of expense      | Yes      | Groceries |
| Description | Store or detail name | Yes      | Maruetsu  |
| Amount      | Expense amount       | Yes      | 3,000 yen |
## System Components
- Screen Z: Allocation Ratio Settings
- Function: Set and save the expense allocation ratio between spouses
  - Example default: Husband 0.7 / Wife 0.3
## Screen A: Expense Entry
Inputs:
- Category (selectable)
- Description (text input)
- Amount (numeric input)
Users: Husband or Wife
Button: "Complete Entry"
## Settlement Logic
- Apply predefined allocation ratios to the registered expenses
- Calculate each person’s share of the expenses
- Automatically determine:
  - Who pays
  - Who receives
  - Settlement amount (difference)
## Notification & Approval Process (via LINE)
### Step 1: Confirmation Notification
After both parties complete their entries, send the following via LINE:
```
[Household Settlement Details]
Category: Groceries
Description: Maruetsu
Amount: 3,000 yen
(Allocation: Husband 2,100 yen / Wife 900 yen)

▼ Please confirm ▼
[OK Button]
```
### Step 2: Mutual Approval
Once both press "OK", send:
To the paying party:
```
Please transfer xxx yen by yyy.
```
To the receiving party:
```
xxx yen will be transferred by yyy.
If not transferred by then, reminders will be sent every z days.
You can adjust z (reminder interval) from this message.
```
### Default Settings
| Item                   | Value                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Settlement Deadline    | 7 days from confirmation |
| Reminder Frequency (z) | Every 1 day              |

Both parties will be informed about the reminder interval (z) the first time and can change it.

## AWS Resource Management

This project includes scripts to manage AWS resources efficiently, allowing you to start and stop infrastructure components to optimize costs.

### Available Scripts

#### Stop AWS Resources
```bash
./scripts/stop-aws-resources.sh
```
- **Purpose**: Stop AWS resources to reduce costs while preserving data
- **Targets**: ECS Services, RDS Instance (keeps data for restart)
- **Features**: 
  - Lists all running resources numerically
  - User confirmation prompt ("停止してOKですか?" y/N)
  - Error handling with success/failure reporting
  - Preserves database data for restart capability

#### Start AWS Resources
```bash
./scripts/start-aws-resources.sh
```
- **Purpose**: Start stopped AWS resources to restore application functionality
- **Targets**: RDS Instance, ECS Services
- **Features**:
  - Lists all startable resources numerically
  - User confirmation prompt ("開始してOKですか?" y/N)
  - Error handling with success/failure reporting
  - Automatic RDS availability waiting
  - Displays application URL upon successful completion

### Resource Types Managed
1. **ECS Cluster**: `splitmate-cluster`
2. **ECS Services**: 
   - Backend Service: `splitmate-backend-service`
   - Frontend Service: `splitmate-frontend-service`
3. **RDS Instance**: `splitmate-mysql` (data preserved during stop/start)
4. **Application Load Balancer**: `splitmate-alb` (always active)
5. **ECR Repositories**: `splitmate-backend`, `splitmate-frontend` (always available)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Appropriate AWS permissions for ECS, RDS, and ELB operations
- Resources must be deployed via Terraform first

### Usage Notes
- **Data Safety**: Database data is preserved during stop/start operations
- **Startup Order**: RDS starts first, then ECS services (recommended)
- **Cost Optimization**: Only compute resources (ECS, RDS) are stopped; storage and networking remain
- **Availability**: Application typically takes 2-5 minutes to become fully operational after start
